    <h1>BNB-B Project</h1>
    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p>BNB:B is an alternative bed and breakfast app. It will allow customers to search any area in the United States for homes to rent and also allow them to submit a rental application form to the owner. Our app will have an innovative style which will make finding rental homes simpler than on other apps. We will use an API to pull data modeling homes for rent and then display that data to the customer based on their search criteria. The customer will then be able to view additional details about each search result. If they like the home, and want to rent it, then they click on the apply button to contact the owner to arrange a rental date.
