            <p>This site covers a huge range of web development. </br></br>
            I have actually used their documentation so many times when I forget syntax. I would assume 100% of developers at some point had to search up syntax/documentation so this website is useful to all programmers. They provide helpful examples that are interactive and I can easily change their code and run it so I understand what is happening. </br>

            <p>Site that provides a ton of images. </br></br>
            This is related to web development because images are a huge part of attractive design because it adds diversity instead of just all text.  In addition, it is a common practice to add event listeners onto images so that’s why I mentioned this site because it will come handy in the future. Useful to all frontend developers </br>

            <p>Youtube channel that primarily focuses on frontend development. </br></br>
            He has many projects and tutorials that I have watched and personally learned a lot from. Sometimes, reading documentation is not as helpful as visualizing and having a ‘teacher’ aspect to it so I stop by this channel a lot. Useful to all frontend developers </br>

            <p>Youtube channel that primarily focuses on CSS </br></br>
            He has tutorials on flexbox, grid, and other css properties. This is obviously useful because as web developers, a huge focus is attractive design/layout. He taught me mostly everything I know about responsive design. </br>

            <p>Subscription-based website that develops frontend engineers </br></br>
            I learned about responsive design, React, pure JavaScript, and calling APIs. These are all useful languages/skills that frontend engineers should know. I can always go back to their lesson plans if I ever need help. </br>
